                Hey, kid, why do you moan? \n
                We can't help but notice that you're home alone! \n
                Your parents clearly trust you to be away without a PHONE CALL! \n
                That's not all, your flashlight is limited \n
                That can't be helpful to keep you prohibited \n
                Don't be scared, it's not like we care \n
                Your nightmare is all that we wanted PREPARED! \n \n
                On the bed, just don't be mislead \n
                Those toys were just meant to like you to be bled \n
                The closet, whoops, I wouldn't run over \n
                'Cause Foxy's inside, yet he seems OUT. OF. ORDER!
