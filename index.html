                Hey, kid, why do you moan? <br>
                We can't help but notice that you're home alone! <br>
                Your parents clearly trust you to be away without a PHONE CALL! <br>
                That's not all, your flashlight is limited <br>
                That can't be helpful to keep you prohibited <br>
                Don't be scared, it's not like we care <br>
                Your nightmare is all that we wanted PREPARED! <br> <br>
                On the bed, just don't be mislead <br>
                Those toys were just meant to like you to be bled <br>
                The closet, whoops, I wouldn't run over <br>
                'Cause Foxy's inside, yet he seems OUT. OF. ORDER!
